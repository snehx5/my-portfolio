<h3>1. Research</h3>
<p>The Mirror project allowed me to test the waters of user experience design and get a better feel for what it was all about.  It was a influential project that enabled me to better understand the user experience design process from start to finish after learning about it in the first segment of the DesignLab course.

  Research for this post capstone project, Mirror involved gaining insight about users' needs and frustrations.  This involved interviewing e-commerce shoppers about their experiences using e-commerce sites, similar to Mirror to find out how to create a better user experience.  User research also involves conducting customer surveys remotely on a large sample of
  varied users to gain more user data than face-to-face interviews.  Face to face interviews are important to have conversations with users to gain better understanding of their experiences, but online surveys help user experience teams acquire massive and unbiased data regarding many users' opinions which is invaluable to user experience design teams that hope to acquire result-driven, winning data regarding users' feelings about potential user interface design choices.  This data is the crux of driving design choices forward.</p>

<h3>2. Information Architecture</h3>
<p>From synthesizing the research, I was able to create a full feature
list of product requirements.  A POV chart helped me define how we might
address user concerns.  Creating a POV chart can help me move towards defining
product requirements.  Using Optimal Sort, we can see how users sort information on the site and
create a sitemap.

<h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
<p>Interaction Design for Mirror involves understanding how users move
  through my site or application by creating both a task flow chart and user flow charts.
  Task flow shows how a user could move through a process in a site/application, while user flows
  show a detailed account of various user flows that a user can take to manuever through a site/application to complete tasks.  Taking our sitemap and task flow we create wireframes, responsive designs, and prototypes of our emerging product.
  With this basic outline, we can conduct usability tests on users to see what parts of the prototype they find difficult to interact with to improve the user experience.  After synthesizing usability test results, we can create an affinity map that assesses users' successes, comments and pains and can garner fruitful insights.  From these quantifiable results, we can understand what features of the site/application need improvement and which features/sections are working.  We can continue to work on the prototype and add user interface design elements that bring the prototype to the next level.

  As we add more user interface design choices which are based on research, we can continue to run
  more usability tests that asssess how users feel about the product.  User experience design is all about understanding how the customer feels about the product and how to continously make the user experience of the product better for end users.

<h3>4. User Interface</h3>
<p>User Interface for Mirror involves assessing the Mirror brand creating a mood board on Pinterest
  that can help us better acquire an understanding of the brand's logo and other user interface style choices from which we can create a ui kit and style guide.
