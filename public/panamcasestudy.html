<h3>1. Research</h3>
<p>Research for the Pan Am project was simple and involved interviewing potential users' of
airlines sites who book travel tickets online. </p>

<h3>2. Information Architecture</h3>
<p>From synthesizing the research, I was able to create a full feature
list of product requirements.  A POV chart helped me define how we might
address user concerns.  Creating a POV chart can help me move towards defining
product requirements.  Using Optimal Sort, we can see how users sort information on the site and
create a sitemap.

<h3>3. Interaction Design</h3>
<p>Interaction Design for Pan Am involves understanding how users move
  through my site or application by creating both a task flow chart and user flow charts.
  Task flow shows how a user could move through a process in a site/application, while user flows
  show a detailed account of various user flows that a user can take to manuever through a site/application to complete tasks.  Taking our sitemap and task flow we create wireframes, responsive designs, and prototypes of our emerging product.
  With this basic outline, we can conduct usability tests on users to see what parts of the prototype they find difficult to interact with to improve the user experience.  After synthesizing usability test results, we can create an affinity map that assesses users' successes, comments and pains and can garner fruitful insights.  From these quantifiable results, we can understand what features of the site/application need improvement and which features/sections are working.  We can continue to work on the prototype and add user interface design elements that bring the prototype to the next level.

  As we add more user interface design choices which are based on research, we can continue to run
  more usability tests that asssess how users feel about the product.  User experience design is all about understanding how the customer feels about the product and how to continously make the user experience of the product better for end users.

<h3>4. User Interface</h3>
<p>User Interface for Pan Am involves assessing the Pan Am brand creating a mood board on Pinterest
  that can help us better acquire an understanding of the brand's logo and other user interface style choices from which we can create a ui kit and style guide.
